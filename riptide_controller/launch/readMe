Launching ROS Controler for Riptide

controller_waypoint.launch : work only when there is no gazebo (file Drivers.py simulate dummy ROS message from sensors)

	roslaunch controller_waypoint.launch json:=path_to_jsonfile/jsonfile.json

controller_heading.launch : work only when there is no gazebo (file Drivers.py simulate dummy ROS message from sensors)

	roslaunch controller_heading.launch heading:=headingInRadians depth:=depthInMetersWithNegativeValue

controller_waypoint_without_drivers.launch : work when there is gazebo (don't launch Drivers.py)

	roslaunch controller_waypoint_without_drivers.launch json:=path_to_jsonfile/jsonfile.json

controller_heading_without_drivers.launch : work when there is gazebo (don't launch Drivers.py)

	roslaunch controller_waypoint_without_drivers.launch heading:=headingInRadians depth:=depthInMetersWithNegativeValue
